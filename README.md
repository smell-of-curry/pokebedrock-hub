# PokeBedrock Server Hub 🎮🌐

The **PokeBedrock Server Hub** is a robust, high-performance central lobby system built with [Dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly). It serves as the gateway into the expansive PokeBedrock network—seamlessly managing server connections, player queues, and navigation between the main servers.
